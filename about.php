<p><h4>Overview</h4>
The SkyWay Group technology is referred to as "string transport"[3] and involves the movement of driverless vehicles on sleeperless tracks elevated above the ground on concrete supports. The "strings" are a bundle of prestressed tensioned steel wires placed in a concrete-filled body.[4] The SkyWay technology has been marketed as a new type of elevated light rail transportation system.<br>

SkyWay has been designed to transport passengers and cargo.[5] Yunitskiy claims his vehicles can reach speeds of up to 500 kilometers an hour and are reported to cost 20 percent less than normal subways.[6] It is also claimed that this technology involves minimal gas and particle emissions.[5] SkyWay claims that its small transport units with variable passengers capacity can travel safely at intervals of only 2 seconds, thus providing a transport capacity of up to 50,000 passengers per hour.[7

<p><h4>History</h4>

<h8>SkyWay test track built in Ozyory, Russia in 2001 which was later deconstructed
Anatoly Yunitskiy is the inventor of SkyWay technology and is also the founder, the director[6] and the main shareholder of companies in the SkyWay Group.[8] He designed the technology in 1980 as a system of passenger and cargo capsules that travel by cable car.[5]

In 2001 a prototype of a SkyWay track was constructed in the Russian village Ozyory in Moscow Oblast. The allowable load on this track was tested there using a truck with iron wheels. This site was later deconstructed.[4] A prototype was assessed in Russia in 2008 by the Moscow State University of Railway Engineering concluding that it was "not viable and unsafe".[3]

In October 2015 the SkyWay Group started constructing a test site to demonstrate 'SkyWay' technology. It is situated in Marjina Horka (about 70 km from Minsk) and is called the EcoTechnoPark.[9] In 2016, a Russian government panel that evaluated the technology called it innovative, but only in theory.[3] A prototype of the technology reached speeds of 102 kilometers per hour in 2017.[5] In August 2018 at the EcoFest event, there were three tracks demonstrating prototypes at this site. One is for a vehicle with a maximum capacity of 48 people. The second track is for a 14-seater vehicle and the third is for a 6-seater vehicle.[10]</h8>

<h4>Operations</h4>
<h8>Company structure
SkyWay Group consists of numerous subsidiaries. The SkyWay Group deals with construction of the technology through numerous subsidiaries. SkyWay Group of Companies controls SkyWay Capital which was launched in 2014 to self-finance the projects.[6] They also own and control other companies like "SWIG International Ltd." registered in London and "SkyWay Capital Inc." which is registered in Saint Lucia. These companies function to collect funds for SkyWay projects.[5]

Established in Belarus,[11] operated from an office complex in Minsk[12] and registered under business names including "Euroasian Rail Skyway Systems Holding Ltd.",[13] "First SkyWay Invest Group Limited"[14][15] and "Global Transport Investment Inc."[16] in places like the British Virgin Islands, London and Saint Lucia.[6] It has been documented that companies in the SkyWay Group seek potential investors all over the world for the development of an elevated rail transport technology they refer to as SkyWay.[5]</h8>

<h4>Marketing</h4>
<h8>The SkyWay Group exhibited a monorail vehicle at the InnoTrans trade fair in Berlin in 2018.
In addition to demonstration models at the EcoTechnoPark in Belarus, the company has exhibited its technology at trade fairs like the 3rd Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE).[17] The SkyWay Group markets itself primarily by promoting investment in its technology to small investors.

SkyWay Group seeks investors through its website and social media.[2] The SkyWay Group have been seeking potential investors all over the world using various forms of marketing such as crowdfunding,[1] telemarketing[18] and multi-level marketing.[5] It has also been documented that the SkyWay Group promote their technology with paid advertising on television and in newspapers,[19] and that financial services are being offered via social media.[2]

The company "Sky Way Invest Group Limited" also launched financial training courses for a fee[20] which it marketed as 'Educational Investment Packages' (EIPs).[21] CONSOB, the Italian financial regulatory agency, banned the sale and advertisement of these investment products in February 2018 because it turned out instead of receiving the "investment training courses" advertised, customers unwittingly ended up with "gift certificates" that could later be converted to company shares on the occasion of its IPO
